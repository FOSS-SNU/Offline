# Offline
## A p2p file sharing platform for intranets. 
Offline is a peer-to-peer file tranfer utility. 
- Offline uses a central server just like DC and connects peers amongst themselves to transfer files. 
- Users can carry out a centralised search for a file amongst all peers.
- Users can explicitly connect to other peers through IP addresses. (This feature is Under Development.)

## Todo
There are a lot improvements yet to be made. 
- Make login and signup pages more secure.
