# Offline
## A p2p file sharing platform for intranets.
Offline is a peer-to-peer file tranfer utility.
- Offline uses a central server just like DC and connects peers amongst themselves to transfer files.
- Users can carry out a centralised search for a file amongst all peers.
- Users can explicitly connect to other peers through IP addresses. (This feature is Under Development.)

### This is not yet complete. Lot of improvements yet to be made.
